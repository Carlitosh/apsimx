\title{Generate a synthetic APSIM soil profile from the ISRIC soil database}
\usage{
get_isric_soil_profile(lonlat, statistic = c("mean", "Q0.5"), soil.profile)
}
\arguments{
\item{lonlat}{Longitude and latitude vector (e.g. c(-93, 42)).}

\item{statistic}{default is the mean}

\item{soil.profile}{a soil profile to fill in in case the default one is not appropriate}
}

Variable which are directly retrieved and a simple unit conversion is performed: \cr
* Bulk density - bdod \cr
* Carbon - soc \cr
* Clay - clay \cr
* Sand - sand \cr
* PH - phh2o \cr
* Nitrogen - nitrogen \cr
Variables which are estimated using pedotransfer functions: \cr
LL15, DUL, SAT, KS, AirDry \cr
TO-DO: \cr
What do I do with nitrogen? \cr
Can I use CEC? \cr
How can I have a guess at FBiom and Finert? \cr
FBiom does not depend on any soil property at the moment, should it? \cr
